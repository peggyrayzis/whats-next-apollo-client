```notes
- i think that mission has resonated with developers because apollo has grown over 400% in the past year
- it's been incredible to see apollo client take off this year and we're reaching nearly half a million downloads per week
- i don't think this is an accident - it's not because graphql and apollo are trendy, it's because it solves real world problems that react developers face every single day and i think you all could attest to this

# State management is hard

<img style={{width: '80vw'}} src='./img/state-mgmt.png' />

```notes
- one of the problems we face as react developers is how to manage state in our applications.
- first we have to pick a state management library with the most popular being redux. then we have to worry about choosing the right middleware, asynchronous action creators, data normalization, and selectors.
- on top of that, we have to execute complicated features like pagination and optimistic ui
```

---

# Apollo removes complexity

<img style={{width: '80vw'}} src='./img/state-mgmt2.png' />

```notes
- apollo removes a significant amount of that complexity for us thanks to its intelligent cache and network stack
- instead of writing thousands of lines of redux boilerplate, all we have to do is write queries and bind them to our UI with a query components
- apollo client will take care of the rest
```

    30% of Apollo Client<br/>
    users are also using<br/>Apollo Link State.
  </h1>
</FullScreenBackground>

```notes
- typically, when people think of apollo client they're thinking of data from a remote server.
- but over the past year, more and more developers are starting to manage their local state with apollo too.
- in fact, 30% of apollo client users are using apollo link state to manage their local data.
```

---

# It started off as an idea:
<img src="./img/draft-link-state.png" style={{width: '60vw', border: `1px ${colors.black} solid`}} />

```notes
- it's amazing to think that apollo link state started off as an experimental idea that was previewed on the graphql summit stage one year ago 
- this idea resonated with developers because it's an elegant programming model and it solves a real need, which is why:
```

---

# Today, these companies are managing their local state with Apollo:

<div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', alignSelf: 'center', justifyContent: 'space-around', marginTop: '80px'}}>
  <img src="./img/paypal.jpg" style={{width: '200px'}} />

  <img src="./img/taskrabbit.png" style={{width: '200px'}} />
  <img src="./img/hilton.jpg" style={{width: '200px'}} />
</div>

```notes
- companies like netflix, airbnb, and hilton are all using apollo client to manage their local data with apollo link state in production
- what caused this to happen? why did this idea take off so quickly
```

---

# One source of truth

<img style={{width: '65vw'}} src='./img/single-source.png' />

```notes
- developers want one source of truth when managing their data. one of the most compelling benefits is that apollo client can handle all types of data
- from graph APIs to local data, and even data from legacy REST APIs, apollo can hold all of it without the need for a separate mobx or redux store
- having one source of truth reduces complexity and mental overhead
```

---

# One interface for your data

<img style={{width: '55vw'}} src='./img/unified-interface.png' />

```notes
- another reason why managing local data with apollo is so revolutionary is that graphql becomes a unified interface to all of your app's data
- our components are usually made up of lots of different types of data
- with graphql, we can query all of that data in exactly the same way and simply pass it down to our component
```

---

# Promise of excellent tooling*
<img src="./img/devtools.png" style={{width: '90vw', border: `1px ${colors.black} solid`}} />

```notes
- finally, i think the early adopters of managing local state with apollo were sold on the promise of bringing the excellent tooling we have on the server over to the client
- if we can leverage graphql's static typing and the concept of a client schema, we can enjoy the same features like autocomplete and jump to schema definitions that we experience when we write queries for remote data
- when we launched apollo link state, this was just a promise however. we had an early version working of devtools that would stitch your client schema and remote schema together in graphiql
- but all of this excellent tooling wasn't 100% there yet.
- for the last 6 months, we've been committed to making this happen however
```

```notes
- with one source of truth for all the data in your app, one unified interface for querying local and remote data with graphql, and excellent tooling, apollo helps react developers by eliminating barriers to building great data-driven apps
- at apollo, we're truly invested in making sure all developers can benefit from our software.

<Quote
  quote="I'm a new frontend developer and our team at code school decided to learn GraphQL and deploy an app using Apollo in 2 weeks for our final project."
  author="Chad Whitaker (@tchadwhitaker), Momentum Learning"
/>

```notes
- recently i asked a question on twitter asking if any bootcamp students or developers new to programming had used apollo before and i was absolutely amazed by the responses
- so many new developers had chosen apollo because it simplified state management in their apps, and they were able to pick it up in only two weeks
- i think this is a testament to how straight forward data management becomes when you build your app with apollo
```

<Quote
  quote="Once you move to Apollo to handle data over the network, it becomes much harder to justify loading a library like Redux for local state management. Apollo fills that need perfectly."
  author="Adam Neary (@AdamRNeary), Airbnb"
/>

```notes
- apollo isn't just for developers starting out, however. although we pride ourselves on a great getting started experience, we also want to make sure our software scales for large engineering organizations
- as you heard in adam's talk earlier this morning, airbnb uses apollo client to manage their remote graph api data, their local data, and their legacy rest data all in a single request
- since they've switched some apps to apollo, they haven't needed to load redux
```

# React developers want an opinionated way to manage data in their apps.

```notes
- so what we've learned from speaking with developers is whether you're new to programming or you work on a large team, everyone wants a straightforward, opinionated way to manage data in their apps
- they don't want to write a ton of boilerplate or synchronize data between multiple stores
- they just want to specify their data requirements and have it show up on the page and apollo fills that need perfectly
- all of these learnings are what have influenced our plan for the next version of apollo client, which is why we're so excited to announce
```
